**Application Support**: We support the installation and use of scientific software across the ICR and on Alma, primarily R and python based tools distributed with github or docker but also bioinformtics command line tools.
  
**Software consulting**: We offer guidance on best practices for software development, code review, and software architecture design.  
  
**Training and workshops**: We provide training on various software development tools and techniques relevant to research activities.  
    
**Collaboration**: We work closely with research teams to understand specific needs and ensure the software aligns with research goals.  

**Web application service**: We can develop and/or host web applications either internally or publicly through docker images.
