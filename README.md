### Service Capabilities and Functions
**Software development**: We help you turn research ideas into functional software tools, from conception to implementation and deployment. 
This can be full software development, adaption and enhancement of existing tools, or rapid prototyping. We specialise in creating bespoke user-friendly applications from an assortment of 3rd party command line tools.

**Application Support**: We support the installation and use of scientific software across the ICR and on Alma, primarily R and python based tools distributed with github or docker but also bioinformatics command line tools.
  
**Software consulting**: We offer guidance on best practices for software development, code review, and software architecture design.  
  
**Training and workshops**: We provide training on various software development tools and techniques relevant to research activities.  
    
**Collaboration**: We work closely with research teams to understand specific needs and ensure the software aligns with research goals.  

**Web application service**: We can develop and/or host web applications either internally or publicly through docker images.
